🚀 Built Signup & Login Authentication for an E-commerce Website

I recently implemented a user authentication system for my e-commerce website using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

🔹 Developed Signup and Login pages using React, handling form inputs and validations on the frontend.

🔹 Created REST APIs using Node.js and Express to process authentication requests.

🔹 Designed MongoDB schemas using Mongoose to securely store user signup details.

🔹 Implemented backend login logic to validate user credentials by checking existing records in MongoDB.

🔹 Ensured proper API responses to identify whether a user is already registered or not, enabling secure access control.

🔹 Achieved seamless frontend–backend integration with reliable data flow and error handling.


This project helped me gain hands-on experience in full-stack development, API creation, database schema design, and authentication logic.
